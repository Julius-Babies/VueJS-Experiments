# About this repository
For my current project, I need to build a web frontend. I used to build them with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript/TypeScript. They all worked, but at some point, they got messy as sh*t. So I started looking around for alternatives. I tried Googles Angular but I didn't like it because of the sheer amount of files. Later on, I tried React, which was created by Facebook in 2013. But I quickly lost interest as I got an error, which I believe I could have fixed if I just followed the tutorial.
I was so annoyed by JS frameworks that I thought about doing it like in the old days, with pure JavaScript. But I quickly remembered the pain of getting node modules and TypeScript to work so I overthought everything. I took a deep breath and decided to take a look at Vue.JS by following a [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hYYGbV60Vq3IXYNfDk8At1) by the NetNija. And I liked it. Both the tutorials and the framework. So that's where I am today. I made some experiments using Vue and was impressed by how easy it is to build a small web app.
